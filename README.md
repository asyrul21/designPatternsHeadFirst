# Design Patterns (Head First)

This is a summary of the book Head First Design Patterns.

It is meant to serve as a language-agnostic Design Pattern reference. Hence, most of the code examples attempt to exclude any Java-specific implementation, or using any Java's built in API libraries.

## How to run the code

You can either run the code via IDE (intelliJ) or via the Terminal.

### To Run via IDE:

1. Open the Main file of the example.

2. Click Run

### To Run via the Terminal

1. Navigate to */src*

2. Compile the class:

    ```bash
    javac StrategyPattern/Example1/SimuDuck.java
    ``` 

3. Run

    ```bash
    java StrategyPattern.Example1.SimuDuckMain
    ```
