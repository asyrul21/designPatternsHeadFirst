# Design Patterns Reference(Head First)

This is a summary of the book Head First Design Patterns.

It is meant to serve as a language-agnostic Design Pattern reference. Hence, most of the code examples attempt to exclude any Java-specific implementation, or using any Java's built in API libraries.
